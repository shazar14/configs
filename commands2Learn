 find ~/ -name "*.py" -exec grep "grepStri*" {} \; -exec ls -la {} \;
find [path] [-name name of files] [-exec execute grep following by regex] [{} take whatever file find gives it]
[\; escape the semicolon to end the command]

this command searches the given path looking in any files ending in .py and then greps for the string grepStri*
it then does a ls -la on the found files 

ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
reconfigure 'wlan0' to new MAC address

lsof -r 10 -i -P +c 0
-r = refresh every 10 seconds
-i = This option selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i.  If no address is
                specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.

                If  -i4  or -i6 is specified with no following address, only files of the indicated IP version, IPv4 or IPv6, are displayed.
                (An IPv6 specification may be used only if the dialects supports IPv6, as indicated by ``[46]'' and ``IPv[46]'' in lsof's -h
                or -?  output.)  Sequentially specifying -i4, followed by -i6 is the same as specifying -i, and vice-versa.  Specifying -i4,
                or -i6 after -i is the same as specifying -i4 or -i6 by itself.

                Multiple addresses (up to a limit of 100) may be specified with multiple -i options.  (A port number or service  name  range
                is counted as one address.)  They are joined in a single ORed set before participating in AND option selection.

                An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in square brackets are optional.):

                [46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]
-c 0 = If w is zero ('0'), all command characters supplied to lsof by the UNIX dialect will be printed.
	prints all characters in the command column (default is 9 characters)
